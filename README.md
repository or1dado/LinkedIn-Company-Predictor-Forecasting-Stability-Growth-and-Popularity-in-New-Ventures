<h2 id="section1">üìö Overview:</h2>
<p id="description">Understanding the potential success of a new company is crucial for various groups of people, including job seekers, employees, investors, and stakeholders. This project aims to address the research question: "How likely is a new company to succeed?" We focus on measures of stability, growth, and popularity for new companies, leveraging LinkedIn data and Google Trends.</p>

<h2 id="section2">‚öôÔ∏è How To Run?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Create companies URLs for Scraping" notebook in Databricks. This step is optional and only required if you intend to conduct the scraping process yourself. The output generated by the notebook will be used in the scraping phase later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the "scrape code.txt" to initiate the scraping process from the URLs extracted in the previus step. Note this step is also optional and is only necessary if you choose to conduct the scraping process yourself. if not, the data is already accessible in the google drive (link in the report).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Merge code" notebook. This notebook is used to merge the output of the scraping process, resulting in the creation of two datasets: the new companies dataset and the established(old) companies dataset. The datasets are being stored in google drive (link attach in the report).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Execute the "Project_preprocess" notebook. Before running this notebook, ensure that you have inserted the paths of the datasets for both new and established companies in Cell 4. In addition, remember to modify the paths in Cell 29,  where the notebook's output will be stored.</p>
        <p>Follow these steps as illustrated in the images below:</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Execute the "Features_analysis" notebook in Databricks. This step is not mandatory and is primarily for those interested in exploring the features. To initiate it, update the paths in cell 7 with the paths you chose in the pre-processing step.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> This step is responsible for computing the stability scores. Execute the "Project_part1_stability" notebook in Databricks. Modify the paths in Cell 7 with the paths saved in the pre-process step. Additionally, modify the paths in Cell 15,  where the notebook's output will be stored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This phase is responsible for computing the popularity scores. Execute the "Project_part2_popularity" notebook in Databricks. Modify the paths in Cell 7  with the paths saved in the pre-process step. Modify the paths of the stability dataframe saved in step 5 in Cell 13. Lastly,modify the paths in Cell 17,  where the notebook's output will be stored. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Project_results" notebook in Databricks again to obtain results and conduct analysis. Modify the paths in Cell 5 to correspond with the paths saved in the pre-process step Additionally, edit the paths in Cells 7 and 9 to match the output paths from step 5 (stability) and 6 (popularity) respectively. To view the images in Cells 31 and 32, replace the paths with those of the image files ('images/quant.png', 'images/kodiak.png').</p>
  </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="section3">üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Data Collection and Integration</h2>
<ul>
<li>We used Linkedin/company dataset, filtering by foundation year to distinguish between established and new companies.</li>
<li>We gathered additional time-series data from Google Trends by querying company names.</li>
<li>We integrated Those two datasets and computed stability, popularity, and growth scores.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section4">üìä Data Analysis and Feature Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>We preprocessed Linkedin/companies dataset by handling missing values and excluding overly common or rare values.</li>
<li>We performed column transformations and feature engineering to enhance model performance.</li>
<li>We employed various methodologies for stability, popularity, and growth measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section5">üß† AI Methodologies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stability Measure: Utilized cosine similarity between new and established companies to predict stability.</li>
<li>Popularity Measure: Trained a linear regression classifier model to predict popularity labels.</li>
<li>Growth Measure: Fitted SARIMA models to forecast growth trends for new companies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section6">üìã Results and Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stability, popularity, and growth scores were predicted for new companies.</li>
<li>Manual evaluations and sampling techniques validated the accuracy of predictions.</li>
<li>Identified industries with the highest potential for success based on model results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section7">üöß Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resource and technological constraints impacted data scraping and model optimization.</li>
<li>Data limitations and quality issues introduced uncertainties and biases in the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section8">üó® Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>We successfully answered the research question regarding new company success likelihood.</li>
<li>We provided valuable insights for stakeholders, laying a foundation for future research and analysis.</li>
</ul>
