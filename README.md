<h2 id="section1">üìö Overview:</h2>
<p id="description">Understanding the potential success of a new company is crucial for various stakeholders, including job seekers, employees, investors, and stakeholders. This project aims to address the research question: "How likely is a new company to succeed?" We focus on measures of stability, growth, and popularity for new companies, leveraging LinkedIn data and Google Trends.</p>
