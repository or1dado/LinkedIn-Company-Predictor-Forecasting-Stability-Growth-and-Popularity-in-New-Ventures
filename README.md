<h2 id="section1">üìö Overview:</h2>
<p id="description">Understanding the potential success of a new company is crucial for various stakeholders, including job seekers, employees, investors, and stakeholders. This project aims to address the research question: "How likely is a new company to succeed?" We focus on measures of stability, growth, and popularity for new companies, leveraging LinkedIn data and Google Trends.</p>

<h2 id="section2">‚öôÔ∏è How To Run?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Create companies URLs for Scraping" notebook in Databricks. This step is discretionary and is solely required if you intend to conduct the scraping process independently. The output generated by the notebook will be utilized in the subsequent scraping phase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Utilize the "scrape code.txt" to initiate the scraping process from the URLs extracted in the preceding phase. This step remains optional and is solely necessary if you opt to conduct the scraping process autonomously. It's worth noting that the data is already accessible in the data file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Merge code" notebook. This notebook is designed to merge the output of the scraping process, resulting in the creation of two datasets: one dedicated to new companies and the other to old companies. The merged datasets will be stored in the specified path: "data/trend_data".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Execute the "Project_preprocess" notebook. Prior to running this notebook, ensure that you have inserted the paths of the datasets for both new and old companies in Cell 4. Moreover, remember to modify the paths where the notebook's output will be stored in Cell 29.</p>
        <p>Follow these steps as illustrated in the images below:</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Execute the "Features_analysis" notebook in Databricks. This step is not mandatory and is primarily for those interested in exploring the features. To initiate it, ensure to substitute the paths in cell 7 with the paths obtained during the pre-processing phase.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch the "Project_part1_stability" notebook in Databricks. Adjust the paths in Cell 7 to correspond with the paths saved in the pre-process phase. Additionally, indicate the path to store the notebook's output in Cell 15. This phase is responsible for computing the stability scores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Project_part2_popularity" notebook in Databricks once more. Modify the paths in Cell 7 to align with the paths saved in the pre-process phase. Additionally, adjust the path of the stability DataFrame saved in phase 5 in Cell 13. Specify the path to save the notebook's output in Cell 17. This phase is responsible for computing the popularity scores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the "Project_results" notebook in Databricks again to obtain results and conduct analysis. Adjust the paths in Cell 5 to correspond with the paths saved in the pre-process phase. Additionally, edit the paths in Cells 7 and 9 to match the output paths from phases 6 (stability) and 5 (popularity) respectively. To view the images in Cells 31 and 32, replace the paths with those of the image files ('images/quant.png', 'images/kodiak.png').</p>
  </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="section3">üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Data Collection and Integration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Utilized LinkedIn's company dataset, filtering by foundation year to distinguish between established and new companies.</li>
<li>Gathered additional time-series data from Google Trends by querying company names.</li>
<li>Integrated Google Trends data for stability, popularity, and growth insights into our predictive models.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section4">üìä Data Analysis and Feature Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Preprocessed LinkedIn data by handling missing values and excluding overly common or rare values.</li>
<li>Performed column transformations and feature engineering to enhance model performance.</li>
<li>Employed various methodologies for stability, popularity, and growth measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section5">üß† AI Methodologies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stability Measure: Utilized cosine similarity between new and established companies to predict stability.</li>
<li>Popularity Measure: Trained a linear regression classifier model to predict popularity labels.</li>
<li>Growth Measure: Fitted SARIMA models to forecast growth trends for new companies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section6">üìã Results and Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stability, popularity, and growth scores were predicted for new companies.</li>
<li>Manual evaluations and sampling techniques validated the accuracy of predictions.</li>
<li>Identified industries with the highest potential for success based on model results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section7">üöß Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resource and technological constraints impacted data scraping and model optimization.</li>
<li>Data limitations and quality issues introduced uncertainties and biases in the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section8">üó® Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Successfully answered the research question regarding new company success likelihood.</li>
<li>Provided valuable insights for stakeholders, laying a foundation for future research and analysis.</li>
